Getting Started 

- Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer
- Install gulp.js to the project directory by running "npm install --save-dev gulp", within a terminal or command prompt
- Run npm install on necessary modules required at the top of the gulpfile.js (Ex: "npm install gulp-less", "npm install path")
- After installing the modules, start your gulp tasks by simply typing "gulp" and hitting enter
- The gulp tasks will convert your less file into a minified css file every time you hit save, with all necessary vendor prefixes for browser support.
